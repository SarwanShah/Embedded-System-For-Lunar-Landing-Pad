## Overview

This repository higlights the work done as the Electrical and Electronics engineering lead on AEGIS - the inflatable lunar landing pad. In its entirety, the novel system was designed, built, and tested by a multidisciplinary team of students from Arizona State University (at the Luminosity Lab) in response to the 2024 NASA BIG Idea Challenge to provide a low Size Weight and Power (SWaP) solution for reducing regolith ejecta generated by lunar landers. The project won the **Best Systems Engineering Award** at the NASA Big Idea Challenge Forum.
